# TDDD27_2020_WebCrawler

This is a project in the course TDDD27


## Functional specification:
Our vision is to create a web application where users can search for scam emails and email addresses. The data will be collected using a web crawler which we will develop. 
The web crawler will be searching through forums to find many of these emails and addresses.

Users of the web application will also be able to discuss the emails and addresses and also add scam email and addresses to the database (these will need approval before being fully added). 
Users will also be able to rate messages by other users (upvote/downvote).


## Technological specification:
For our back-end we will be using Django. On the front-end we will be using React + Redux. The database management system we will be using is SQLite.

The web crawler will be developed in Python using Selenium. 

Selenium might be used for testing as well.
